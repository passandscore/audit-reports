# Smart Contract Audit Reports

> Next Audit: [TempleDAO](https://www.codehawks.com/contests/clxyjvjkg0007isl3p290etog)

Hey there! Welcome to my Smart Contract Audit Reports repository. This is where I've compiled all my audit reports assessing the security and functionality of various smart contracts. You'll find insights into vulnerabilities we've uncovered during our assessments, along with recommendations to beef up the security of these contracts.

> This is a work in progress. I am a full time Solidity developer but have been making contracts for employers and have not had the time to perform audits regularly. That is about to change, and you can expect more reports to be added soon.

## About the Reports

I'm Jason Schwarz, and I've authored these audit reports to help developers, auditors, and blockchain enthusiasts grasp potential security issues in smart contracts. My goal is to promote best practices for secure smart contract development through these findings.

## What's Inside?

- Each audit report dives deep into:
  - Detailed analysis of smart contract functionalities.
  - Identification of vulnerabilities and potential exploits.
  - Recommendations and best practices to enhance security.
  - Sometimes, I even throw in code snippets to illustrate identified issues!

## How to Use Them

Developers and auditors can use these reports to:
- Understand common security pitfalls in smart contracts.
- Implement strong security measures during their contract development.
- Get insights from real-world examples of audits carried out by yours truly, Jason Schwarz.

## Contributing

If you spot any issues in the audit reports or have suggestions for improvements, please don't hesitate to [open an issue](link-to-issues) or send in a pull request. Your contributions help maintain the accuracy and relevance of these reports.
